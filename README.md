Zakat Mirath Ease Admin Panel
Overview
Zakat Mirath Ease is a robust administration panel designed to manage all aspects of a financial platform dedicated to Zakat (obligatory charity) and Mirath (inheritance) processing. The admin panel provides a unified dashboard where administrators can manage services, transactions, beneficiaries, subscription plans, financial reporting, user accounts, and settings. It integrates role-based access control (CBAC) to tailor the experience for different user types (e.g., Admin, Premium, Basic), ensuring that critical functions and data remain secure and relevant.

Key Features
Unified Dashboard:
A single-page interface with a responsive layout that includes a header, a sliding sidebar, and a dynamic main content area.

Sidebar Navigation:
A consistent sidebar (250px wide) that allows quick navigation between key modules:

Dashboard
Services & Subscription Management
Categories (if needed)
Admins
Charts & Reports
Settings
Logout
Transaction Management:

Overview cards displaying key financial metrics (e.g., Total Donations, Pending Donations).
Forms for adding new transactions.
A table for listing and managing transactions with duplicate-checking functionality.
Services Management with Category-Based Access Control (CBAC):

Each service is tagged with a specific access level (Basic, Premium, Admin) to control visibility based on user roles.
A role selector dynamically filters services, ensuring that users see only what they’re authorized to access.
Forms for adding new services, including fields for name, description, category, required access level, and an optional icon URL.
A service table with working deletion functionality.
Subscription Plans Management:

Overview cards that summarize total subscription plans, active plans, and monthly earnings.

General settings (site title, logo URL, timezone)
Notification settings (email/SMS alerts)
Security settings (multi-factor authentication, password policy)
Integration settings (API endpoints for CRM, HR systems, etc.)
Data Visualization & Reporting:
(Optional) Integration with Chart.js to provide dynamic, interactive charts and graphs for monitoring financial and operational metrics.

Usage
Navigation
Sidebar Navigation:
Use the sidebar to navigate seamlessly between the Dashboard, Services, Categories, Admins, Charts, Reports, and Settings pages. The sidebar can be toggled via the menu button.

Role-Based Access Control:
On the Services page, use the role selector to filter services based on the current user’s access level. For example, Admins see all services, Premium users see Premium and Basic services, while Basic users only see Basic services.

Managing Transactions & Services
Transactions:
Add new transactions using the provided form and review them in the transactions table. Duplicate transaction entries can be automatically removed.

Services:

Use the “Add New Service” form to input details such as service name, description, category, required access level, and an optional icon URL.
The services table displays each service with a delete button to remove it from the list.
The role-based filtering mechanism ensures that users see only the services appropriate to their role.
Subscription Plans
Subscription Management:
Add or edit subscription plans using the dedicated form. Input details such as plan name, price, description, and status.
The subscription plans table shows all current plans, and each plan includes a delete button for easy removal.
Overview cards (optional) display summary information like total plans, active plans, and monthly earnings.
Settings
Settings Module:
Use the settings module (available on a dedicated page or integrated into the dashboard) to configure general site settings, notification preferences, security options, and integration endpoints.
Advanced Details
Category-Based Access Control (CBAC):
Categories (or required access levels) are integrated with services so that content is dynamically filtered based on user roles. This system provides a data-driven method for managing which services appear to which users.

Responsiveness & Design Consistency:
The admin panel uses a responsive layout that adjusts for different screen sizes. The design is consistent across all modules, ensuring a professional and seamless user experience.

Extensibility:
The project is designed to be modular. Functions for adding, editing, and deleting items (services, transactions, subscription plans) are implemented in plain JavaScript. This makes it straightforward to integrate with a backend API or expand with additional functionality (like real-time updates or data visualization).

Security Considerations:
While the current implementation uses dummy JavaScript functions for demonstration, future iterations should integrate proper authentication, role-based access control, and secure data handling practices.

Future Enhancements
Backend Integration:
Connect the front-end forms to a backend API (using AJAX or Fetch) for data persistence and real-time updates.

Enhanced Editing Functionality:
Implement in-place editing features for services, transactions, and subscription plans.

Advanced Reporting & Analytics:
Integrate advanced data visualization (e.g., using Chart.js) to provide dynamic dashboards and detailed financial reports.

User Authentication:
Build robust user authentication and session management, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive operations.

Performance Optimization:
Optimize the code and design for faster load times and smoother transitions across all modules.
